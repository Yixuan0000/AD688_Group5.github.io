## Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

We used MLR to examine the relationship between job attributes and salary. After feature engineering and one-hot encoding, the model achieved an $R^2$ of 0.87, indicating strong predictive ability. Key variables influencing salary included state, experience level, and educational background.

## Random Forest Regressor

To compare with a non-linear approach, we implemented a Random Forest Regressor. Despite its flexibility, the model achieved a lower $R^2$ of 0.25, highlighting its limitations with high-dimensional sparse data. Feature importance showed that skill count and experience dominated predictions.

## Model Comparison

| Metric        | MLR         | Random Forest |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| RMSE          | 77,772      | 63,755         |
| R-squared     | 0.87        | 0.25           |

MLR provided more reliable insights for interpreting salary trends, while Random Forest offered useful feature ranking.
